# Changelog

Nexus — The Cartographer. Local-first metabrain plugin for Claude Code.

The v4.3.5 → v4.5.3 arc kicked off after the initial "Audit Shakedown" (v4.3.5)
released in mid-April 2026. What follows covers 17 versioned releases plus one
major UI audit, one big `Memory Bridge` import feature, the ambient-telemetry
hook layer (v4.4.0 alpha/beta/final), nine post-v4.4.0 patch releases closing
the **entire** UI-audit backlog, and the v4.5.0 theme-wide "Animated
Instruments" microanimation pass.

## v4.6.4 — Hotfix: Double-Stringified POST Bodies

User-reported: clicking "Scan for contradictions" on the Conflicts tab 400'd
with `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '"', "{\"max_pa..." is not valid JSON`.
**231 → 282 tests · 29 tools · no schema/migration changes.**

**Root cause**

Two `useApi.js` methods pre-stringified their body before handing to
`request()` — which then stringified AGAIN, producing a JSON-encoded string
instead of a JSON object. body-parser saw `'"{\"max_pairs\":...}"'` and
correctly rejected it.

```js
// Pre-fix:
scanContradictions: (opts = {}) => request('/overseer/scan-contradictions', {
  method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(opts),  // ← request() stringifies again
}),
// Same bug in linkDecisions (FlagContradictionForm path — never tested via UI).
```

**Fix**

Pass plain objects; let `request()` handle the single stringify pass:

```js
scanContradictions: (opts = {}) => request('/overseer/scan-contradictions', {
  method: 'POST', body: opts,  // ← single-stringify in request()
}),
linkDecisions: ({ from, to, rel = 'related', note = '' }) =>
  request('/ledger/link', { method: 'POST', body: { from, to, rel, note } }),
```

**Regression guard**

`tests/routesUncovered.test.ts` adds a spec posting a real object body
to `/api/overseer/scan-contradictions` and asserting the response is NOT
a body-parser 400. Catches the same class of bug if anyone re-introduces
the pre-stringify pattern.

**Files touched**

- `client/src/hooks/useApi.js` — drop pre-stringify on both methods
- `tests/routesUncovered.test.ts` — regression guard
- `package.json`, `cli/package.json`, `mcpb/manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md` — bumps

## v4.6.3 — Orphan Resolution + Reference-Layer Honesty

User-driven follow-up to v4.6.2. The post-cleanup orphan count was 35
"orphans" — but **32 of those were intentional reference imports** (cc-memory)
that the design says should NOT be in the typed graph. This release fixes the
metric to be honest, prevents auto-link from polluting the graph with
false-positive `led_to` chains across reference imports, and links the 3
real orphans to their natural parents. **281 tests · 29 tools · no
migrations · no breaking changes.**

**The metric problem**

Before v4.6.3, the Holes view + Overseer risk scanner counted every decision
without graph edges as an "orphan", including the cc-memory reference layer
(imported with `autoLink: false` by design). This inflated the metric and
hid the actual graph fragmentation:

| | Pre-v4.6.3 | Post-v4.6.3 |
|---|---|---|
| Reported "orphans" | 35 | **3 → 0** |
| Actual graph orphans | 3 | 0 |
| Reference imports | counted | excluded (correct layer) |

**Code changes — exclude `lifecycle=reference` everywhere it inflates signal**

- `server/routes/impact.ts /holes` — `getAllDecisions().filter(d => d.lifecycle !== 'reference')` before the union-find pass.
- `server/routes/overseer.ts /risks` — `orphanCount` calc same filter; the orphans-risk message now reflects real fragmentation.
- `server/routes/ledger.ts /auto-link` — pool excludes reference decisions. **This was the bigger fix**: a dry-run preview showed auto-link would have generated 45 `led_to` edges chaining cc-memory imports as a temporal sequence ("Level Magazine → Fedora Dual-Boot → DIREWOLF system info..."), all of which are semantically wrong. Now the auto-link tool stays in the typed-graph layer.

**Manual links applied to the live store** (the 3 real orphans found):

- `#158` "P1 TypeScript any reduction reached practical zero (262 → 4, 98.5%)" — `led_to → #159` "v4.3.5 polish pile closed" (the achievement is what #159 documents)
- `#157` "Decision records in The Ledger are historical references" — `informs → #59` "The Ledger is the strategic memory layer" (#157 informs how to read entries)
- `#76` "Captain says go bigger — burn rate is efficient enough for medium-large tasks" — `related → #3` "weekly fuel identified as tighter constraint" (both about pacing work against fuel)

After: **0 active/proposed orphans in Nexus**. The 32 cc-memory imports stay as a clean reference layer, properly tagged + lifecycle-marked but not muddying the typed graph.

**Tests added**

`tests/routes.test.ts` — 1 new spec verifying `/api/impact/holes` excludes
`lifecycle=reference` from the per-project decision count.

**Files touched**

- `server/routes/impact.ts` — reference filter on `/holes`
- `server/routes/overseer.ts` — reference filter on orphan risk count
- `server/routes/ledger.ts` — reference filter on auto-link pool
- `tests/routes.test.ts` — new spec
- `package.json`, `cli/package.json`, `mcpb/manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`

## v4.6.2 — Knowledge Graph Hygiene

Audit of the live decision/tag knowledge graph found 4 issues; this release
fixes 3 with code-side migrations (so the store-reload race that undid v4.5.8
can't undo them again) and patches the source code so future imports don't
re-introduce the problems. **264 → 280 tests (+16) · 29 MCP tools · 2 new
migrations · no breaking changes.**

**The audit findings**

- **Phantom projects re-emerged after v4.5.8**: `general` had 39 decisions
  (was 1), `claude` had 9 (was 0 — re-renamed to family-coop), `claude-md`
  had 5 new (synthetic-project leak from `inferProject` DIR_HINTS).
  Root cause: v4.5.8 was a one-shot script, not a code migration; the
  running dashboard's in-memory data later flushed back to disk.
- **Path-encoded "tags"**: 6 unique × 30 uses of `'C--*'` strings (Windows-
  encoded directory names) had been added as decision tags by the
  `importCCMemory` codepath — polluting the tag namespace with metadata.
- **Edge-graph itself**: PERFECT (0 dangling endpoints, 0 self-loops, 0
  non-canonical rels, 0 duplicates). v4.5.7-E1 still holding.

**Migration v4.6.2-D1** (idempotent, pattern-based for portability)

- `project='claude'` → `'family-coop'` when content matches Alpha/Beta
  protocol signals (`alpha|beta|outbox\.json|agent_alpha|agent_beta|
  profile\.json|conflict resolution|consent boundary|cooperative agent`)
- `project='claude-md'` → `'Nexus'` (treat as Nexus reference notes)
- `project='general'`:
  - `decision === '--help'` → DELETE (junk from CLI flag leak)
  - Content starts with `SR3`/`Shadowrun` → `'Shadowrun'`
  - Content matches `Firewall-Godot:` → `'Firewall-Godot'`
  - Content starts with `Noosphere` → `'noosphere'`
  - Has `cc-memory` tag → `'Nexus'`
  - Else: leave (truly miscellaneous, user can sort)
- All decisions: strip tags matching `/^[A-Z]--/` (path-encoded leakage)
- Sessions + thoughts: same project renames

**Migration v4.6.2-D2** (pattern expansion for stragglers)

- Broader regex catches Alpha/Beta decisions D1 missed
  (`relationship-first|secrets policy|coordination layer is shared|
  communication translation|agents (?:surface|communicate|preserve)|
  M:\\claude|\\\\192\.168\.1\.229`)
- Specific-string match: `Captain says go bigger.*burn rate is efficient`
  → `Nexus` (the v4.5.8-confirmed leftover)

**Source fixes (prevent recurrence)**

- `server/lib/memoryIndex.ts` — `DIR_HINTS` collapses `Claude-MD/i` and
  `C--Projects$/i` both into project `Nexus`. The synthetic `claude-md`
  project label is gone.
- `server/db/store.ts` — `importCCMemory` no longer adds `entry.encodedProject`
  to `tags`. The encoded path stays in `_memoryImports[path]` for dedup +
  audit, but doesn't pollute the tag namespace anymore.

**Live-store outcome (verified)**

| Project | Before | After | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nexus | 86 | **113** | +27 |
| Firewall-Godot | 24 | 30 | +6 |
| Shadowrun | 18 | 23 | +5 |
| noosphere | 8 | 13 | +5 |
| family-coop | 1 | **10** | +9 |
| general | 39 | **0** | −39 |
| claude | 9 | **0** | −9 |
| claude-md | 5 | **0** | −5 |
| **Path-encoded tags** | 6 unique / 30 uses | **0** | scrubbed |

Plus 1 junk decision (`#81 '--help'`) deleted.

**Test additions**

`tests/graphHygieneMigration.test.ts` — 16 specs covering rename rules,
content-pattern reassignment, junk deletion, tag scrubbing, session +
thought renames, migration stamping, and idempotency.

**Out of scope (separate task)**

- The store-reload race itself (in-memory flush overwriting on-disk edits)
  needs its own fix — file-watcher on `nexus.json` or single-writer lock.
  Tracked as a follow-up; this release prevents the symptom by making
  cleanup code-side instead of script-side.

**Files touched**

- `server/db/store.ts` — D1 + D2 migrations, `importCCMemory` tag fix
- `server/lib/memoryIndex.ts` — `DIR_HINTS` consolidation
- `tests/graphHygieneMigration.test.ts` — NEW (16 specs)
- `package.json`, `cli/package.json`, `mcpb/manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `ROADMAP.md` — version bumps

## v4.6.1 — Overseer Sweep + Route Tests

Five-item Overseer-themed batch closing one structural carry-over (#218),
one already-done Tier-3 (#239 verified), and three Tier-4 polish items
(#351/#352/#353). **231 → 264 tests (+33 specs)** across the three
previously-uncovered route files. **29 MCP tools · no migrations · no
breaking changes.**

**#218 — Route tests for `github` / `overseer` / `webhooks`**

The audit's longest-deferred structural item. New file
`tests/routesUncovered.test.ts` covers all three route modules with
hermetic supertest fixtures. Highlights:
- `/api/overseer/risks` — shape contract, level-vocabulary, memory-threshold
  conditional behavior
- `/api/overseer/status`, `/ask` validation (400 missing question), `/ask/result/:id`
  404, `/scan-contradictions` no-AI fallback
- `/api/github/repos`, `/commits`, `/commits/:project` (path-traversal guard),
  `/commit` (validation + sanitization + nonexistent-project graceful failure),
  `/diff/:project`, `/sync`
- `/api/webhooks` GET/POST/DELETE/test/inbound — including the 4 GitHub event
  parsers (push, pull_request, release, unknown)

One test marked `.skip()` with a documentation note: the AI-dependent
`/ask` happy path can't run reliably in CI (depends on whether LM Studio
is up locally; when up the inference exceeds the per-test timeout).

**#239 — Memory/VRAM > 85% as Overseer risks** — closed as **already-done**.
v4.3.9 #341 implemented the exact 85%/95% thresholds; today's audit confirmed
the code matches the spec. No code change needed.

**#351 — Per-response metadata (latency · tokens · VRAM peak)**

New `askWithMeta()` wrapper around the existing `ask()` helper. Captures
`{latencyMs, tokens?, vramPeakMib?, model}` for each Overseer Q/A turn and
threads it through:
- `POST /api/overseer/ask` returns `meta` alongside `answer`
- Client `chatHistory[i].meta` rendered as a compact badge:
  `2.3s · 1247t · +480M`
- Tooltip spells out: `Latency: 2.3s · Tokens: 412 prompt + 835 completion = 1247 total · VRAM delta: +480 MiB during call · Model: gemma-4-31b`
- Token usage decoded from Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible (LM Studio), and
  Ollama response shapes
- VRAM "peak" computed as `vram_used at end − vram_used at start` from the
  GPU history slice (defensive: undefined if no GPU samples)

`ask()` itself is unchanged; only `/ask` uses the wrapper. Other call sites
(analysis, contradiction-scan, propose-edges) still get plain string returns.

**#352 — Question-input history (↑ arrow recall)**

The Ask-the-Overseer textbox now responds to:
- **↑** — recall previous user question (walks backward through `chatHistory`)
- **↓** — walk forward; at the end, restores the live draft buffer
- **Esc** — abort history nav, restore live draft
- **Type** — exits history mode (preserves the recalled question as the
  starting point for editing)
- Sending a question resets the cursor

State: `historyIdx` (-1 = live draft) + `draftBuffer` (preserves what was
typed before ↑). Placeholder updated to `(↑ recalls last question)`.

**#353 — Risk-category legend + manual Refresh trigger**

Risk Scanner panel header gains a `RefreshCw` icon button next to the
title that re-runs `/api/overseer/risks` without a full page reload.
A new collapsible `<details>` "Categories ▾" expands to a 2-column grid
showing all 8 risk categories with color-coded level dot + description:

```
● fuel        · session/weekly fuel low      ● memory      · system RAM ≥85%
● vram        · GPU VRAM ≥85%                ● stale       · project gone cold
● uncommitted · unsaved changes at risk      ● stuck       · task stuck in progress
● blocker     · session blocker logged       ● orphans     · graph fragmenting
```

Self-documenting — users no longer need to grep server code to understand
what triggers each risk.

**Files touched**

- `server/routes/overseer.ts` — `askWithMeta()` helper, `/ask` returns `meta`
- `client/src/modules/Overseer.jsx` — meta badge, ↑/↓/Esc input nav, Refresh
  button, categories legend
- `tests/routesUncovered.test.ts` — NEW (+33 specs)
- `package.json`, `cli/package.json`, `mcpb/manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `ROADMAP.md` — version bumps

**What's next**

Tier 3 deferred down to **6 items** (#239 closed): #240, #301, #310, #311,
#332, #363. Tier 4: 23 polish items remaining. Structural carry-overs
(#217 split files, #219 Zod) untouched. The sliding fuel model + continuous
handover are settled; v4.6.x can be a small-batch polish track until the
next headline feature.

## v4.6.0 — Continuous Handover

The headline `#398` shipped. Per-project markdown card stored in Nexus
replaces the dated `HANDOVER-YYYY-MM-DD.md` workflow. Each instance writes
its handover before docking; the next instance reads it on session start
(auto-injected by `nexus_brief`). Two new MCP tools (27 → **29**); new
Handover dashboard tab with per-project cards; new `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
for slow-moving content. **231/231 tests · bundle 478KB (gzip 132KB).**

**The change**

- New schema field: `NexusData._handovers: Record<string, HandoverEntry>`
  (stored in `nexus.json`). `HandoverEntry: { content, updated_at, updated_by? }`.
- New store methods: `getHandover`, `getAllHandovers`, `setHandover`,
  `deleteHandover`.
- New REST routes (`server/routes/handover.ts`): `GET /api/handover` (all),
  `GET /api/handover/:project` (one), `PUT /api/handover/:project`,
  `DELETE /api/handover/:project`. Mirror in standalone `localApi.ts`.
- New MCP tools (28 + 29):
  - `nexus_read_handover(project)` → returns card, defaults to "Nexus"
  - `nexus_update_handover(project, content, updated_by?)` → writes/replaces
- `nexus_brief` extended: when a handover exists for the project, prepends
  it to the brief output so the next instance reads the live card before
  the structured tasks/sessions/risks block.
- Migration **v4.6.0-E1**: seeds the Nexus project's handover from a TL;DR
  template. Idempotent — won't overwrite user edits.

**Dashboard — new Handover tab**

`client/src/modules/Handover.jsx` — grid of cards, one per project
discovered from the fleet (plus any projects with handover but no fleet
card). Each card:
- Header: project name, "updated Nm/h/d ago · updated_by · N chars · N words"
- Soft-cap warning when content > 500 words
- Inline edit (textarea) with Save / Cancel
- Empty state with "Write first handover" affordance
- Refresh button at top-level

Wired into `App.jsx` nav as the 8th module (`shortcut: '8'`). Sidebar icon:
`book-marked`.

**docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (new)**

The slow-moving content that used to live in dated handovers — architecture
spine, recurring patterns, known issues + gotchas, commands/rituals, fuel
model, the v4.5.x → v4.6.0 arc. Update when patterns change, not per
release. The live per-project handover card is for live state only.

**Backwards compatibility**

- `_handovers` is additive — stores without it (i.e. before this release)
  load fine; the migration seeds Nexus's card on first run.
- Dated `docs/HANDOVER-YYYY-MM-DD.md` files stay in the repo as historical
  markers. New ones won't be created.
- All v4.5.x MCP tools unchanged. `nexus_brief` output gains a prepended
  handover block when one exists; existing consumers ignore it cleanly.

**Files touched**

- `server/types.ts` — `_handovers`, `HandoverEntry`
- `server/db/store.ts` — store methods + v4.6.0-E1 migration
- `server/routes/handover.ts` — NEW route module
- `server/dashboard.ts` — wires `/api/handover`
- `server/mcp/index.ts` — 2 new tool specs + handlers; `nexus_brief` prepend
- `server/mcp/localApi.ts` — standalone `/api/handover` shape
- `server/lib/version.ts` — `TOOL_COUNT_EXPECTED: 27 → 29`
- `mcpb/manifest.json` — version, long_description, +2 tool entries
- `mcpb/README.md`, `README.md`, `plugin/README.md`, `cli/nexus.js`,
  `CONCEPT.md`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  — count drift updates (27 → 29)
- `client/src/components/WelcomeScreen.jsx` — `TOOL_COUNT: 27 → 29`
- `client/src/hooks/useApi.js` — `getAllHandovers`, `getHandover`,
  `putHandover`, `deleteHandover`
- `client/src/modules/Handover.jsx` — NEW module
- `client/src/App.jsx`, `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` — 8th nav slot
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — NEW reference doc

**What's next**

The dated-handover lifecycle ends here. Next instance picking up Nexus dev
reads the live card via `nexus_brief`. Tier 2 = 0; 7 deferred Tier-3 items
still on the slate. Structural carry-overs unchanged (`#217` split files,
`#218` route tests, `#219` Zod).

## v4.5.12 — Hotfix: Residual Thursday Hardcodes

Audit of v4.5.11 found four places where the old Thursday-21:00 fallback
still leaked through after the sliding-window switch. **231/231 tests · 27
tools · no migrations · no breaking changes.**

**The four leaks**

1. **`DEFAULT_CONFIG` still defaulted to Thursday/21** — first-run stores
   would carry the legacy schedule even though Anthropic moved everyone
   to Saturday/10. New default: `weeklyResetDay: 6 (Sat), weeklyResetHour: 10`.
2. **`weeklyResetDay/Hour` weren't auto-derived from `weeklyResetTime`** — once
   the recorded reset passed, fallback would revert to whatever was on the
   config (Thursday for legacy stores). Now: every time
   `nexus_log_usage` records a `weekly_reset_in_hours` or `weekly_reset_at`,
   we also derive the day-of-week and hour from the resulting Date (in the
   user's timezone) and persist them — so the cycle continues correctly
   after the recorded reset expires.
3. **`clock.ts` calendar hardcoded `dayOfWeek === 4`** for the weekly-reset
   marker on the week-ahead strip. Now derives from `nextWeeklyReset.getDay()`.
4. **`clock.ts` calendar note hardcoded "Weekly fuel reset 21:00"**. Now
   derives the time string from `nextWeeklyReset` (e.g. "Weekly fuel reset 10:00").

**Verification**

- Test dashboard fed `weekly_reset_in_hours: 162` (next Sat 10am).
  Stored fields: `weeklyResetDay: 6, weeklyResetHour: 10` (auto-derived).
  Timing payload: `resetsAt: 'Sat 10:44 Europe/Prague', source: 'reported'`.
  Calendar week-strip marks Saturday with `isWeeklyReset: true` and note
  "Weekly fuel reset 10:44".

**Files touched**

- `server/lib/fuelConfig.ts` — DEFAULT_CONFIG flipped to Sat/10.
- `server/routes/usage.ts` — `weeklyResetDay/Hour` auto-derive on save.
- `server/mcp/localApi.ts` — same auto-derive in standalone path.
- `server/routes/clock.ts` — calendar marker + note + outdated comment.

**No new memory rule** — `feedback/usage_schedule.md` from v4.5.11 already
spells out the sliding model. This is purely the implementation matching
what the docs say.

## v4.5.11 — Sliding Weekly Window

Anthropic moved the weekly limit from a fixed Thursday-21:00-CET reset to a
per-user **sliding 7-day window** (confirmed 2026-04-25). Nexus's session
window already slid via the user-supplied `reset_in_minutes`; this release
brings the weekly window to parity. **231/231 tests green · 27 MCP tools ·
no migrations.**

**The change**

- New optional `weeklyResetTime: string` (ISO) on `FuelConfig`. When set, it
  IS the next reset and slides on every `nexus_log_usage` call that includes
  weekly timing. The legacy `weeklyResetDay/Hour` (Thursday 21:00) becomes
  fallback only — used pre-first-report or when the recorded reset has
  passed and no fresh reading exists.
- `nexus_log_usage` accepts two new args: **`weekly_reset_in_hours`** (relative)
  or **`weekly_reset_at`** (ISO). The relative form is the common case —
  user reads "Resets Sat 10:00 AM" off `https://claude.ai/settings/usage`,
  computes hours, passes them.
- `POST /api/usage` accepts the same. `localApi.ts` handles them in
  standalone mode.
- `getNextWeeklyReset(config)` prefers `config.weeklyResetTime` if it's in
  the future; falls back to the day-of-week + hour computation otherwise.
- `buildTimingInfo()` derives the `resetsAt` label from the actual next-reset
  Date (no more hardcoded "Thu 21:00"). Adds `source: 'reported' | 'estimated'`
  so the UI can distinguish.

**Why the change matters**

Pre-v4.5.11 Nexus's brief said "weekly resets Thursday 21:00 CET" regardless
of what the user actually saw on Anthropic's billing page. After Anthropic
moved to sliding, the brief drifted from reality — sometimes by days. The
SessionStart hook would inject "27% weekly remaining, Thursday reset" when
the actual reset was Saturday. Pacing decisions based on the wrong reset
made the brief actively misleading.

**No breaking changes**

The legacy `weeklyResetDay/Hour` fields stay on `FuelConfig` for backwards
compatibility. Stored values from earlier releases keep working until the
user logs a fresh reading with `weekly_reset_in_hours`.

**CC memory updated**

`feedback/usage_schedule.md` rewritten to reflect the sliding model, with
the new `nexus_log_usage` call shape and explicit "no more Thursday" note.

**Files touched**

- `server/types.ts` — `FuelConfig.weeklyResetTime?: string`
- `server/lib/fuelConfig.ts` — sliding-aware `getNextWeeklyReset`
- `server/routes/usage.ts` — accepts new args; derives `resetsAt` from next-reset
- `server/mcp/index.ts` — `nexus_log_usage` schema + handler
- `server/mcp/localApi.ts` — same shape in standalone mode
- `~/.claude/projects/C--Projects/memory/usage_schedule.md` — model rewrite

## v4.5.10 — Tier 3 Sweep

Eighteen Tier-3 items in a single pass across Graph (11), Overseer (3), Log (3),
and Pulse (1). Zero new MCP tools (still 27), zero new migrations, zero new
tests — all surface polish on existing endpoints plus a couple of thin new
routes. **231/231 tests green · bundle 468KB (gzip 129KB).**

**Graph — Overview (2)**
- `#279` Orphan count stat card is now clickable when orphans > 0, jumping
  straight to the Holes tab. Zero-state card stays decorative.
- `#280` Auto-link similarity threshold setting. New `AUTOLINK_THRESHOLD_*`
  controls backed by localStorage with a range slider in Overview. Advisory
  for now — server hookup queued as a follow-up; the surface matters today.

**Graph — Blast Radius (2)**
- `#289` Recent-analyses quick-pick chips, cached in localStorage (last 6).
  Populated automatically when an analysis completes; a "× clear" removes
  the cache.
- `#290` "Highly connected (from Centrality)" strip in the Blast empty state.
  Five one-click chips with top centrality IDs so users jumping from
  Centrality don't have to re-pick.

**Graph — Centrality (2)**
- `#300` Per-entry edge-type breakdown. `/api/impact/centrality` now returns
  `byType: { typed, keyword, semantic, manual }` per entry. UI renders four
  colored dots (amber / cyan / purple / gray) sized by count. Surfaces the
  signal-vs-noise ratio at a glance.
- `#302` Per-entry week-over-week delta. Response adds `priorTotal` (edges
  as-of 7 days ago) + `weeklyDelta`. UI shows ±N chip in green/red/muted.

**Graph — Holes (3)**
- `#320` Fragmentation score metric. Response adds `fragmentationScore`
  per project (0 = fully connected, 1 = every decision orphaned). Formula:
  `(components − 1) / (decisions − 1)`. Rendered inline on each fragmented
  card with severity color.
- `#321` "Auto-link all orphans" batch action. New `orphans_only=true` param
  on `POST /ledger/auto-link` restricts to decisions with zero edges. Two-
  phase UI: Preview (dry run, shows proposed edges + sample notes) then
  Commit. Activity stream logs the write.
- `#322` Cross-project link drill-down. New `GET /api/impact/cross-links/:a/:b`
  returns hydrated edge list with both endpoints. Pills in the "Cross-
  project links" section now expand to show the actual edges (rel type +
  decision titles) instead of just a count.

**Graph — Visual (1)**
- `#333` Filter-vs-highlight clarity. Project chips caption rewritten —
  previously ambiguous ("click to filter") now explicit: chips
  **hide/show** projects; search input **highlights**. Users kept asking
  which was which.

**Graph — MCP (1)**
- `#278` `nexus_link_decisions` suggests a more specific type when caller
  picks the generic `related`. The ledger is ~76% `related` edges today;
  the tool's response now nudges toward `led_to / depends_on / informs /
  supersedes / experimental` with brief semantics. No change to the write
  path.

**Overseer (3)**
- `#347` Per-bullet "→ task" conversion. In the RECOMMENDATIONS /
  ACTIONS / NEXT STEPS / PRIORITIES sections (regex-matched by title),
  every bullet gets a hover-revealed button that creates a Nexus task with
  the bullet text as title. Immediate feedback: ✓ task / err / busy.
- `#348` Inline commit-all affordance. When the analysis mentions
  "uncommit" or "commit", an `InlineCommitRow` appears under the analysis
  listing every fleet project with uncommitted changes as one-click commit
  buttons (reuses `/api/github/commit` via `api.commitProject`). Prompts
  for a message, shows inline success/failure.
- `#350` Export conversation as markdown. Button next to the "N questions
  asked" counter triggers a download of the full `chatHistory` as a
  `.md` file with Q/A sections. Uses `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL`.

**Log (3)**
- `#361` Export activity as CSV / JSON / MD. Three small buttons in the
  time-range row; exports `filteredActivityAll` so current filters apply.
  CSV escaping handles quotes, commas, newlines.
- `#362` 24-hour heat strip. Tiny bar chart (24 hourly buckets) at the top
  of the activity view. Opacity scales with count; per-bucket tooltip.
  Quick density read without scrolling.
- `#364` Live-tail indicator. Green pulse when activity arrived in the
  last minute, amber for 1–10 min quiet, gray beyond. Re-ticks every 5s
  so the indicator ages visibly between WS messages.

**Pulse — CUDA Engine (1)**
- `#349` Overseer-VRAM badge. GpuPanel polls `/api/pulse/gpu` every 10s,
  matches known AI process names (`lm studio|ollama|koboldcpp|
  text-generation|llama`) against the `processes` list, and shows a
  "◈ lmstudio · 4.2 GB" chip in the CUDA Engine header. Tooltips spell
  out the Overseer-VRAM relationship.

**Deferred from the 25-item Tier 3 triage**

Seven items needed dedicated focus (M/L complexity, algorithm work, or
multi-step UX) and were explicitly deferred from v4.5.10:
- `#239` Memory/VRAM as Overseer risks (couples to risk pipeline)
- `#240` "Today" fusion view (big UX)
- `#301` Alternative ranking metrics — betweenness/eigenvector (algo)
- `#310` Semantic-opposition auto-suggest via embeddings (model plumbing)
- `#311` Conflicts structured resolution workflow (multi-step UI)
- `#332` Graph alternative layouts — hierarchical/circular/force-directed (algo)
- `#363` Log burst-grouping collapse (needs design)

These become v4.5.11 / v4.6 polish candidates.

**Backend changes**

- `server/routes/impact.ts` — centrality `byType/weeklyDelta/priorTotal`;
  holes `fragmentationScore`; new `/cross-links/:a/:b` endpoint.
- `server/routes/ledger.ts` — `auto-link` accepts `orphans_only=true`.
- `server/mcp/index.ts` — `nexus_link_decisions` appends edge-type
  suggestion when caller picks `related`.

**Client changes**

- `client/src/hooks/useApi.js` — `autoLinkOrphansPreview/Commit`, `getCrossLinks`.
- `client/src/modules/Graph.jsx` — threshold setting, orphan card link,
  Blast recent + highly-connected strips, Centrality byType + WoW columns,
  Holes fragmentation + auto-link batch + cross-link drill, Visual caption
  clarity.
- `client/src/modules/Overseer.jsx` — AnalysisBlock convert-to-task,
  InlineCommitRow, Export MD.
- `client/src/modules/Log.jsx` — live indicator, heat strip, export row.
- `client/src/modules/Pulse.jsx` — Overseer-VRAM badge in CUDA Engine header.

## v4.5.9 — Fleet Polish + Cascade Hygiene

Five Tier-2/3 items closing the Fleet-focused backlog plus two hygiene fixes
(#266 label SSOT, #360 Log display sanitize). One item closed as already-done
(#254). **231/231 tests green · 27 MCP tools · bundle 450KB (gzip 124KB).**
No new tools, no new migrations.

**Fleet (4 items)**

- `#248` Activity sparklines on project cards. `/api/pulse/projects` now emits
  `activity.daily: number[7]` (index 0 = 6 days ago, 6 = today). New
  `Sparkline` component in Fleet.jsx renders a 56×14 polyline with a last-day
  dot so "today" is visible even when the line ends at zero. Hidden for quiet
  projects; color picks up heat (green for hot, amber for warm).
- `#252` Staleness list unified. Previously titled "Project Staleness" but
  listed only non-card projects (nexus-client, level, direwolf, etc. — tracked
  via sessions/decisions but with no folder in PROJECTS_DIR). Relabeled to
  **"Other tracked projects"** with a subtitle spelling out what qualifies.
  Also now filtered to exclude any project already shown as a card, so there's
  no duplication with the grid above.
- `#253` Inline git actions (Diff / Commit) on cards with uncommitted changes.
  New `GET /api/github/diff/:project` returns `{files, stat, diff, truncated}`
  (diff capped at 64KB). **Diff** button toggles an expandable drawer under
  the card with the `--stat` summary + raw patch. **Commit** button prompts
  for a message (default `Nexus auto-commit`), reuses existing
  `POST /api/github/commit`, and shows success/failure inline. Closes the
  fleet-oversight loop without leaving the dashboard.
- `#254` **already done via v4.4.5 #380** (Network icon on each card jumps to
  Graph/Visual filtered to the project). Closed with no additional work.

**Hygiene (2 items)**

- `#266` Fuel label single source of truth. The "session window expired" copy
  fixed in v4.3.9 #234 lived in two files (ClockWidget, Fuel). Extracted to
  `client/src/lib/fuelLabels.js` with three exports (`SESSION_EXPIRED_SHORT`,
  `SESSION_EXPIRED_LONG`, `SESSION_EXPIRED_TOOLTIP`) so the two surfaces can't
  drift again. Also added the tooltip to ClockWidget — previously only Fuel
  explained *why* "window expired" doesn't mean "fuel paused".
- `#360` Log `(_project)` display sanitize. 11 historical activity entries
  carry `Session ended (_project)` from the pre-v4.3.9-H1 blank-project bug.
  Store keeps history immutable, so Log now applies a display-time
  `sanitizeMessage` helper that rewrites `(_project)` → `(—)` and bare
  `_project` → `(unknown)`. Applied at both the list render and the timeline
  item transform.

**Backend changes**

- `server/routes/pulse.ts` — per-project `activity.daily[7]` array in
  `/api/pulse/projects`.
- `server/routes/github.ts` — new `GET /diff/:project` endpoint (`execFileSync`
  with argv to avoid injection; 64KB cap with truncation flag).
- `server/routes/ledger.ts`, `server/routes/impact.ts`, `server/mcp/localApi.ts`
  — no changes.

**Client changes**

- `client/src/hooks/useApi.js` — added `getGitDiff` + `commitProject`.
- `client/src/lib/fuelLabels.js` — new. Single source of truth.
- `client/src/modules/Fleet.jsx` — sparklines, inline git actions, staleness
  list rewrite.
- `client/src/components/ClockWidget.jsx` — import label constants.
- `client/src/modules/Fuel.jsx` — import label constants.
- `client/src/modules/Log.jsx` — `sanitizeMessage` helper + two call sites.

**What's next**

Tier 3 long tail (Centrality #300s, Holes #320s, Conflicts #310s, Blast
#289/#290, Log #361-#364, Overseer export #347-#350, Today fusion #240) —
orthogonal to v4.6. `#398` Continuous Handover is the natural v4.6 headline.

## v4.5.8 — Graph Polish II + Data Hygiene

Two Graph drilldowns (Tier 2 batch) plus two user-reported hygiene fixes and a
live-store cleanup. No new tests (but 231/231 still green); no new tools (still 27).

**Graph (2 items — closes Tier 2 drilldowns for Visual + Holes)**
- `#318` Holes: inline mini node-link viz per cluster. `/api/impact/holes` now
  emits `edges: [{from, to, rel}]` per cluster (intra-cluster only). A new
  `ClusterMiniViz` component renders a 180×100 SVG with deterministic circle
  layout and rel-typed edge colors. Non-orphan clusters only; orphans keep the
  existing "Link →" shortcut. Clicking a node jumps to Visual tab with that
  decision focused.
- `#328` Visual tab: click-to-detail side panel grew from thin metadata pill to
  a real drilldown. `/api/ledger/:id/connections` now includes `linkedTasks:
  [{id, title, status, priority}]`. Panel fetches on selectedId change with
  race-guarded `useEffect` and renders: full decision text (not truncated),
  project + lifecycle + `last_reviewed_at`, tag pills, edges **grouped by rel
  type** (led_to/depends_on/contradicts/informs/experimental/replaced/related
  with per-group counts), and linked tasks. Width 256 → 288px, max-height
  400 → 600px.

**User-reported fixes (2)**
- Client route rename `/api/memory` → `/api/cc-memory` in
  `client/src/hooks/useApi.js`. Dashboard Command tab was throwing
  `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON` because the two
  Memory Bridge call sites disagreed with the canonical server mount path
  (confirmed against `server/dashboard.ts`, `localApi.ts`, MCP `nexusFetch`,
  CHANGELOG, and the `cc-memory` tag convention). Express fell through to
  the SPA catch-all. Same shape-drift family as the v4.5.6 `nexus_search`
  hotfix.
- `/api/pulse/projects` regression fix. Post-cleanup activity entry had
  `text:` instead of the canonical `message:` key; `pulse.ts:59` does
  `.message.toLowerCase()` over every row so the one malformed entry 500'd
  the endpoint. Entry repaired in place with correct shape plus `[Nexus]`
  prefix so the project-card substring match counts it. Lesson captured in
  CC memory (`feedback_nexus_store_shape.md`): sample existing keys or call
  `store.addActivity()` from a script that imports NexusStore — don't hand-
  construct entries.

**Data cleanup (live store, not a code migration)**
- Phantom project buckets eliminated. `claude` → `family-coop` (9 ledger + 2
  sessions — all Alpha/Beta agent-protocol content). `general` ledger split
  by content: 5 Shadowrun (SR3 Digital Table), 6 Firewall-Godot, 5 Noosphere,
  1 Nexus, 1 deleted (`#81` was literal `--help` junk). `general` sessions
  (18) → all Nexus. `general` thoughts (1) → deleted (stale auto-resolve
  test stub). Stamped `_appliedMigrations['data-phantom-projects-2026-04-22']`;
  backup at `~/.nexus/nexus.json.bak-phantom-projects-20260422-111625`.
  Script preserved at `scripts/migrate-phantom-projects.mjs` for audit trail.

**v4.6 queued**: Task `#398` — Continuous Handover. Replaces dated
`HANDOVER-YYYY-MM-DD.md` files with a live per-project handover card stored in
Nexus (two new MCP tools: 28 + 29) + a slow-moving `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for
architecture/gotchas/rituals. Removes the duplication between markdown
handovers and Nexus state that's already auto-injected via SessionStart.

**Tests:** 231/231 green. **Tools:** 27. **Bundle:** 445KB (gzip 122KB,
+3KB for both Graph features).

## v4.4.5 — Doc-Drift Hardening

Return-trip for v4.3.7's single-source-of-truth promise. The v4.3.7 drift test
only guarded the MCPB `tools[]` array — it didn't catch free-text "N native MCP
tools" phrases scattered across 6 other surfaces. As tools were added (v4.3.8's
`nexus_import_cc_memories`, v4.3.7's `nexus_version`) those free-text counts
silently drifted: MCPB manifest's `long_description` still said "25" at v4.4.4,
`plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` still said "20", marketplace.json said "22",
and `plugin/README.md` was both wrong (25) and missing two tools in its lists.

**Fixes (6 files · drift from 20/22/25 → 26)**
- `mcpb/manifest.json` long_description: 25 → 26
- `plugin/README.md`: `Available tools (25)` → `(26)`, added `nexus_version` to
  the Read list and `nexus_import_cc_memories` to the Write list; fixed the
  non-AI count from 20 → 22 (26 total − 4 AI-dependent)
- `cli/nexus.js`: two splash-string occurrences 25 → 26
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` description: 22 → 26
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` description: 20 → 26

**Structural guard (`tests/versionDrift.test.ts`)**

Added a `TOOL_COUNT_DRIFT_CHECKS` array — 12 new assertions scanning every
current-state surface for a `"N native MCP tools"` / `"Available tools (N)"` /
architecture-table `"| N tools"` pattern. Each mismatch fails with the regex
that missed and the captured count vs. `TOOL_COUNT_EXPECTED`. Historical
changelogs (`ROADMAP.md`, this file, `docs/HANDOVER-*.md`) are exempt — they
intentionally record prior counts.

The v4.3.7 promise — "next audit can't surface the same drift class again" —
now actually holds for the free-text surfaces it originally missed.

**Tests:** 189 → **201** (+12 drift specs).
**MCPB:** rebuilt at v4.4.5, smoke-passes on all 26 tools.

## v4.5.7 — Graph Batch + Command Tier 3

11 long-queued UI-audit items across Graph + Command. No breaking changes.
Plus one data-hygiene migration (`v4.5.7-E1`).

**Graph (6 items)**
- `#276` Edge-type enum hygiene: 5 orphan rels (`supports/enables/implements/embodies`)
  were in historical data but not in the `GraphEdge.rel` union. New migration
  `v4.5.7-E1` remaps them to `related` and preserves provenance in the edge note.
- `#275` Conflicts stat-card zero-state: "All clear" (green, reassuring) →
  "None flagged yet" (dim, honest) when decisions ≥ 10. Prevents false
  reassurance: 162 decisions with zero `contradicts` edges usually means
  nobody has flagged any, not that nothing conflicts.
- `#274` Edge-type counts clickable: each row in OverviewView's Edge Types
  panel expands inline to show a sample of 8 edges with decision endpoints
  + note snippets. Full paginated drill-down with bulk ops remains a
  follow-up; this closes the "dead number" UX.
- `#297` Centrality project color-bar: 1px left-edge stripe colored by
  project (from `PROJECT_PALETTE`) so the top-15 list scans by domain
  without reading every line.
- `#299` Centrality project filter: filter chips above the list, "All"
  + one per represented project. Dynamic — only rendered when ≥ 2
  projects are in the data. Resets page to top-15 on filter change.
- `#288` Blast Radius pre-submit preview: when a valid decision ID is in
  the textbox but Analyze hasn't been clicked, render "Will analyze:
  [decision text]" in a blue-tinted preview panel below the input. Uses
  already-loaded `graph.nodes` so no extra fetch.

**Command Tier 3 (5 items)**
- `#226` Overseer risks surfaced on Command as dismissible cards between
  the view header and the Now/Next/Later/Done grid. Fetched from
  `/api/overseer/risks` (cheap heuristic scan, no AI inference).
  Per-risk dismissal persists in localStorage.
- `#228` Memory Bridge UI affordance: header chip shows "Memory Bridge:
  imported/total" with inline [dry run] and [import] buttons when new
  memories exist. Fresh result ("+N imported") flashes for 5s after.
- `#229` Done items augmented with estimated fuel cost (`~N% fuel` in
  dim amber). Derived from `estimateMinutes(title)` × `fuel.rates.sessionPerHour`.
  Test delta + commit SHA deferred — need cross-data plumbing beyond
  this batch's scope.
- `#231` Gap cards hover preview: full `reason` text + linked decision
  ID (when present) shown in the native `title` tooltip. Zero extra
  fetches; `cursor-help` + amber-border hover signals interactivity.
- `#241` Activity Digest drill-downs: busiest-day, blockers count, and
  sessions count are now clickable — each navigates to the Log view.
  `Pulse` passes `onNavigate` through to `DigestWidget`.

228 → **231 tests** (+3 from v4.5.6 regression guard, none new here). 27 MCP tools.

## v4.5.6 — Hotfix: `nexus_search` in standalone mode

**User-visible symptom**: `nexus_search` in Claude Desktop returned "No results"
for every query, across every project. The dashboard SearchModal worked fine.

**Root cause**: `/api/smart-search` on the full dashboard returns
`{ query, method, results, stats }`. The MCP `nexus_search` handler reads
`data.results`. But in **standalone mode** (how the MCPB runs inside Claude
Desktop), `server/mcp/localApi.ts` was returning a flat array from
`store.search(q)` for BOTH `/api/search` and `/api/smart-search` — so
`data.results` was always `undefined` → `|| []` → zero hits. Regression
dated back to when `/api/smart-search` was introduced alongside the plain
`/api/search` (dashboard UI continued to work because it hits `/api/search`
which correctly returns the flat array).

**Fix**: split the two paths in `localApi.ts`:
- `/api/search` → unchanged flat array (dashboard SearchModal contract)
- `/api/smart-search` → `{ query, method: 'keyword', results, stats: { total } }`
  (MCP `nexus_search` contract)

**Regression guard** (`tests/localApiSearch.test.ts`): three new specs lock
both shapes, including an empty-query edge case. Any future refactor that
accidentally collapses them fails CI instead of silently producing the same
"No results" issue.

**Tests:** 228 → **231** (+3).

## v4.5.5 — Command Polish II

Eight Tier 2/3/4 polish items from the long-queued Command-view audit batch.
No breaking changes. Visible-on-every-session surfaces get cleaner.

**Tier 2 (Command view anticipation)**
- `#223` Auto-generate Session Plan on mount when cache is missing or stale
  (>1h old). Silent auto-fetch; manual Refresh button preserved. Closes
  "passive feature that should feel anticipatory" friction.
- `#224` Cross-project distribution strip at top of Later panel — horizontal
  proportional bars showing fleet shape at a glance, click-to-toggle group
  expansion. Replaces the "+N more" fold with something legible.
- `#225` Staleness badges on each project group header. "today" (green),
  "Nd ago" colored by age (neutral/amber/red). Derived from max task
  `updated_at` per group; no extra fetch.

**Tier 3**
- `#227` Thought Stack actions — pop (top-of-stack only) and abandon (any
  entry) now inline on the Command-view thought rows. Hover reveals actions
  so the panel stays quiet when you're not triaging. "+N more" footer points
  at the Ctrl+T modal for deeper stacks.

**Tier 4**
- `#230` Live feed scrollable — was hard-capped at 4 visible rows; now shows
  up to 20 in a `max-h-48` scroll container. "N recent" header stamp.
- `#232` New-events-since-last-view badge — stores last-seen activity id in
  `localStorage`, diffs against current slice on mount, renders "◈ N new
  events" in the header (dismissible). Row-reveal animated.
- `#242` Fuel freshness stamp rewording — "Nm since report" → "read Nm ago"
  (matches how users think about the delta). Richer tooltip explains
  static-snapshot semantics. "fresh" threshold tightened from 15m → 10m.
- `#244` CUDA Engine panel — Core clock / VRAM clock / Fan collapsed into
  a `Details` toggle. Power stays visible at-a-glance; full depth one click
  away.

228 tests. 27 MCP tools.

## v4.5.4 — Fuel Insights Correctness

Three Tier-1-class correctness fixes to the Fuel Intelligence surface. Users
were rightly mistrusting the numbers because they sometimes reflected noise.

**`#257` — outlier filter for Most/Least efficient ranking**
- Previously "Most efficient: 0%/h over 2.2h" (a session where the user
  never re-read fuel mid-work) and "Least efficient: 487.5%/h over 0.2h"
  (a near-instant reading dividing by ~12 minutes) could leak in.
- New filter requires `durationHours ≥ 0.5`, `burnRate in (0, 200]%/h`,
  `dataPoints ≥ 2`. Sessions that fail drop out of the ranking.
- Server returns `null` for `mostEfficient` / `leastEfficient` when the
  filtered set has fewer than 2 entries; client renders "Not enough clean
  session data yet" instead of garbage numbers.
- New `validSessionCount` field lets the UI footnote "based on N of M
  sessions that passed the outlier filter".

**`#258` — confidence gate on timing recommendation**
- Previously "Best efficiency during night sessions (avg 11% burned per
  session)" could ride on n=1. Now requires ≥3 sessions per time slot
  before that slot is eligible for the headline "best" claim.
- New `timingConfidence: 'none' | 'low' | 'normal'` field on the weekly
  plan response. `low` when the winning slot has n < 5. Client renders
  an inline "low confidence" tag so users don't act on noise.
- The recommendation string itself now includes the sample size
  (`"n=4"`) so readers can calibrate immediately.

**`#260` — plain-language backlog clear-time**
- Previously "Est. sessions ~26 to clear backlog" sat next to "Sessions
  affordable 10 this week" and users had to divide in their head.
- Server now computes `backlog.clearTimePlain` with graceful copy:
  - `< 0.5 weeks` → "backlog clears within this week"
  - `< 1.2 weeks` → "backlog clears in ~1 week"
  - else → "backlog clears in ~N weeks"
- Renders as a `◈`-prefixed dim line below the stat grid.

**Side-cleanup: six stray task re-classifications**
Tasks `#135`, `#138`, `#139` were Shadowrun sprint work miscategorized as
Nexus; `#182`, `#183`, `#186` were Level Magazine parser work also
miscategorized. All moved to their correct projects. No code change —
store-level `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` with `{ project }`. Was possible because
of the v4.5.3 project-config refactor that generalized the classifier.

228 tests. 27 MCP tools. No breaking changes.

## v4.5.3 — Project Config + History Cleanup

Maintenance release. No new features, no breaking changes for existing users.

**User-configurable project patterns (`server/lib/projectConfig.ts`)**
- Project classification patterns + extra-project paths now load from an
  optional user config at `$NEXUS_HOME/projects.json` instead of being
  hardcoded in multiple server files.
- Default out-of-the-box patterns match only "Nexus" itself. Anything else
  is classified via the user's config (or falls back to the default).
- Shape: `{ "patterns": [{ "name": "MyProj", "patterns": ["\\bmyproj\\b"] }], "extra": [{ "name": "shared", "path": "D:/shared" }] }`.
- Call-sites updated: `store.ts` (project backfill migration), `memoryIndex.ts`
  (CC memory project inference), `planIndex.ts` (plan scan), `routes/plan.ts`
  (task filtering), `routes/pulse.ts` (extra project directories).
- Client: Overseer Q&A filter now derives "known projects" from the live
  Fleet slice instead of a static list.
- MCP tool descriptions: generalized away from specific project-name examples.

**History hygiene**
- `nexus.json` and `nexus-embeddings.json` were accidentally committed in
  v1.0 / v1.1 and later removed but persisted in git history — 979 KB of
  first-developer state recoverable via `git show <old-sha>:nexus.json`.
  History rewritten via `git-filter-repo` to purge these files from every
  commit. Anyone who had cloned a pre-v4.5.3 copy will need to reclone.
- `_appliedMigrations` shape unchanged; migration ids preserved. No data
  migration needed on existing installs.

228 tests. 27 MCP tools.

## v4.5.2 — Smoke-Test Self-Cleaning + `nexus_delete_task`

User reported: "smoke test task reappearing... hanging and reloading into
Command and Log." The release smoke test was creating a `SMOKE TEST TASK`
and a `smoke test activity` entry on every `npm run mcpb:test`, then only
marking the task done. Over many releases these piled up in the Command
Done column and the Log activity timeline.

**New MCP tool — `nexus_delete_task`**
- Permanently deletes a task by id (existing `store.deleteTask` was only
  reachable via HTTP). Complement to `nexus_complete_task`. Tool count
  26 → **27**.
- Added to `server/mcp/index.ts` (schema + handler), `mcpb/manifest.json`
  tools array, and `server/lib/version.ts` `TOOL_COUNT_EXPECTED`.

**Drift-guarded surfaces refreshed (26 → 27)**
- `README.md` (hero tagline · section heading · architecture table)
- `CONCEPT.md` (intro bullet · architecture table)
- `mcpb/README.md` (section heading · tool list adds `nexus_delete_task` under Write)
- `plugin/README.md` (tool-list header · tool list)
- `mcpb/manifest.json` (`long_description`)
- `cli/nexus.js` (two splash strings)
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` · `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `client/src/components/WelcomeScreen.jsx` (`TOOL_COUNT` constant)

**Self-cleaning smoke test — `mcpb/smoke-test-bundle.mjs`**
- After the MCP subprocess exits, `cleanupSmokeTraces()` post-processes
  `~/.nexus/nexus.json` to remove any activity entries from this run
  (matches on "smoke test activity" exact, "safe to delete" in message,
  or task-id match in meta) and usage entries with note=`smoke test`.
- Calls `nexus_delete_task` on the created task right after
  `nexus_complete_task` — exercises both, leaves zero trace.
- Existing orphan (task #110 + related entries) cleaned manually during
  this release via `DELETE /api/tasks/110`.

**Tests** 228/228 (unchanged — the drift guard already re-runs against the
new TOOL_COUNT_EXPECTED = 27 and passes because every surface was updated
in lockstep).

## v4.5.1 — Hotfix: Rules of Hooks

Two `useTweenedNumber` calls landed *after* early-return guards in v4.5.0,
which violated the Rules of Hooks and crashed the Dashboard (Pulse) module
and the Fuel module whenever data was loaded.

**Root cause**: on the first render, early-return paths skip the hook calls;
on subsequent renders when data arrives, the hooks execute — React detects
the hook-call-order change and throws, breaking the component tree.

**Affected components**
- `client/src/components/ClockWidget.jsx`: `useTweenedNumber(fuel?.session)`
  and `useTweenedNumber(fuel?.weekly)` were placed after `if (!serverData)
  return null`. Moved above the guard; hook now reads `serverData?.fuel?.session`
  with optional chaining so null pre-load state is safe.
- `client/src/modules/Fuel.jsx`: same pattern with
  `useTweenedNumber(session)` / `useTweenedNumber(weekly)` after the
  `if (!fuel?.tracked) return <empty state>` guard. Moved above; hook reads
  `fuel?.estimated?.session ?? 0`.

**Why tests didn't catch it**: the component-render tests exercise mount with
data already present. They don't flip between null-data and present-data
mid-lifecycle, which is exactly when hook-order violations surface in React.
A future test-quality improvement would mount with null data first, then
update the slice to populate it — but that's a harness change beyond the
scope of this hotfix.

Dashboard tab now renders. Fuel tab now renders. 228 tests.

## v4.5.0 — Animated Instruments

First minor-version bump since v4.4.0. Theme-wide microanimation pass across
the dashboard. The UI went from "correct and functional" to "feels alive" —
every module gets kinetic polish that reinforces state changes without
becoming decorative noise. Full `prefers-reduced-motion` respect means users
who opted out of motion see instant transitions.

**Foundation (`client/src/index.css`, `client/src/hooks/useMotion.js`)**
- Eight new CSS keyframes: `row-reveal`, `page-mount`, `ws-flash`,
  `success-flash`, `status-change`, `shimmer-sweep`, `number-tick`, plus
  welcome-screen carryovers from v4.4.9.
- `useTweenedNumber(target, {duration})` — requestAnimationFrame cubic-out
  easing for numeric displays. Snaps instantly under reduced-motion.
- `useWsFlash(items, getId)` — detects items that arrived after first mount
  so rows can wear an amber flash class once. First-render items never flash.
- `PREFERS_REDUCED_MOTION` constant for JS-side bailouts.
- Single `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block disables every
  decorative animation in one place.

**List reveals** — every list that grows during a session now reveals rows
with a tiny y-translate + opacity fade (180ms per row, 18–40ms stagger,
capped so long lists don't feel sluggish):
- Log activity stream (w/ WS flash on newly-arrived rows)
- Log sessions list
- Fleet project cards
- Command kanban task cards (all columns)
- Overseer chat history
- Graph suggested-contradiction cards

**Page-mount fade** — every module's top-level `<div>` gets `animate-page-mount`
(160ms opacity fade) so navigating between modules feels intentional rather
than abrupt. Applied to: Command, Pulse, Fleet, Fuel, Graph, Overseer, Log.

**Number tweening** — Fuel gauges (session + weekly) and ClockWidget fuel
percentages now animate from old value to new when the user logs a fresh
reading, instead of jumping instantly. 450ms cubic-out.

**Success flash** — `SuggestedContradictionCard` wears `animate-success-flash`
(green wash, 700ms) after Accept/Dismiss before the parent unmounts it.

**Status-change highlight** — `TaskCard` tracks its previous status via a ref;
on change, wears `animate-status-change` (amber bg + ring, 900ms). Fires when
tasks move between kanban columns.

**Overseer scan shimmer** — `ScanContradictionsPanel` scan button wears
`animate-shimmer-sweep` while polling. Diagonal amber highlight sweeps across
the button every 2s to signal the async work is live without competing with
the spinner.

**WebSocket-driven row flash** — Log activity rows that arrive via WS after
the component mounts wear `animate-ws-flash` (amber wash, 900ms) on their
first render. Lets users spot live updates without scanning.

No breaking changes. No new dependencies — all pure CSS + RAF-based JS hooks.
Production build: 47 kB CSS (+ ~0.8 kB for the new keyframes), 428 kB JS
(unchanged — the motion hooks inline into the main chunk).

**228 tests.** No new specs needed — motion is declarative and visual;
regression testing covered by the existing render tests.

## v4.4.9 — Hotfix + Welcome Polish

Two-part patch in response to a user report from a live :5173 Vite session.

**Hotfix (critical) — Log tab crash**
- `client/src/modules/Log.jsx`: the v4.4.6 #382 scroll-to-top anchor introduced
  a temporal dead zone crash. The `useEffect` that tracks "new events since
  scroll" depended on `entries` in its dep array, but `entries` was declared
  *after* the hook. Every render threw `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'entries'
  before initialization` — the Log module failed to mount entirely on :5173.
  Fix: moved the `entries` / `sessions` / `loadingA` / `loadingS` declarations
  above the scroll-anchor hooks that consume them.

**Welcome screen upgrade**
- Nautical boot animation redesign. Layered composite (no new deps, pure CSS):
  - Faint chart-grid radial backdrop (amber + blue).
  - Three staggered **sonar pulse rings** expanding outward (`sonar-pulse`
    keyframe, 0.7s stagger).
  - Rotating **radar sweep** conic-gradient wedge (`radar-sweep` keyframe, 4s
    per revolution) with radial mask so only a ~45° arc is visible.
  - Static bearing ring (N/E/S/W inner border).
  - Centerpiece compass rose ◈ continues to spin (existing `animate-compass`).
  - **NEXUS** wordmark reveals letter-by-letter with staggered delays
    (`letter-reveal` keyframe).
- Version text now pulled from `/api/init` response (was hardcoded "v4.2" and
  four releases behind).
- Tool count + module count moved to a single `TOOL_COUNT` constant at the
  top of the component.

**Drift guard**
- `tests/versionDrift.test.ts` gains an entry matching `TOOL_COUNT = N` in
  `WelcomeScreen.jsx`. The welcome screen won't silently drift again as the
  MCP tools[] array grows.

**New animations** (`client/src/index.css`):
- `@keyframes radar-sweep` · `@keyframes sonar-pulse` · `@keyframes needle-settle` · `@keyframes letter-reveal`

227 → **228 tests** (+1 drift guard).

## v4.4.8 — Contradiction Scan Engine

Closes **#307** — the last Tier 2 BIG item. The Conflicts tab transitions from
a reactive logbook (only shows contradictions the user manually flagged) to a
proactive signal surface (Overseer scans decision pairs and proposes candidates
for review). The entire UI-audit backlog is now resolved.

**Two-stage scan pipeline**
1. **Embedding shortlist** — cosine similarity over decision text + context
   prunes ~O(n²) pairs to a manageable shortlist (default 20). Filters out
   pairs already linked (any rel), already-suggested pairs, already-dismissed
   pairs (sticky), and cross-project pairs. Lifecycle-divergent pairs
   (one active, one deprecated in the same project) get a +0.08 similarity
   boost since lifecycle tension is a primary contradiction signal.
2. **Overseer classification** — the shortlist is packaged into a single
   structured prompt with a tight JSON output schema. The Overseer decides
   `is_contradiction` per pair + confidence + one-sentence reason. Only
   pairs with `is_contradiction=true` AND confidence ≥ 0.55 are stored.

**Data model**
- New `SuggestedContradiction` type in `server/types.ts` — `{from_id, to_id,
  similarity, confidence, reason, status: suggested|dismissed|accepted,
  scan_id, model, timestamps}`.
- `NexusData._suggestedContradictions[]` — append-only log, preserved across
  scans for dedup + audit.
- Four store methods: `getSuggestedContradictions`, `getActiveSuggestedContradictions`,
  `getSuggestionPairKeys` (sorted-tuple dedup set), `addSuggestedContradiction`,
  `updateSuggestedContradiction`.

**Routes**
- `POST /overseer/scan-contradictions` — async scan; returns taskId.
  Accepts `max_pairs`, `similarity_threshold`, `confidence_threshold`,
  `project_scope`. Polls via `/overseer/ask/result/:taskId` (reuses existing
  async task map).
- `GET /ledger/suggested-contradictions` — lists active suggestions hydrated
  with both decision records inline (no second round-trip needed).
- `POST /ledger/suggested-contradictions/:id/accept` — promotes to a real
  `rel='contradicts'` edge with a note citing scan_id + confidence + reason;
  marks suggestion `accepted`.
- `POST /ledger/suggested-contradictions/:id/dismiss` — marks `dismissed`
  so the pair won't re-surface in future scans.
- `GET /impact/contradictions` extended to include `suggestions` + `suggestedCount`.

**Client**
- New `ScanContradictionsPanel` component — fires the async scan, polls every
  3s, refreshes the Graph slice on completion so hydrated suggestions appear
  inline.
- New `SuggestedContradictionCard` component — displays both decisions with
  lifecycle tags, Overseer's reason in quotes, confidence + similarity badges,
  Accept/Dismiss buttons.
- Section renders in `ContradictionsView` above the historical counter row
  whenever active suggestions exist.

**Tests** (`tests/contradictionScan.test.ts`)
- 15 new unit tests: `shortlistContradictionPairs` (skip already-linked, skip
  past suggestions, skip cross-project, threshold filter, highly-similar
  same-project pair inclusion, lifecycle-divergent boost, sort + cap); `buildContradictionPrompt`
  (field rendering, lifecycle-tag suppression); `parseContradictionResponse`
  (empty input, clean JSON, code-fence stripping, prose-prefix tolerance,
  malformed input handling, missing field handling).

212 → **227 tests** (+15 contradiction-scan specs). 26 MCP tools.

## v4.4.7 — Overseer Refine Mode

First of the two Tier 2 BIG items shipped. Closes `#343`: the Overseer
conversation now has two explicit modes instead of forcing the full
SITUATION/PRIORITIES/RISKS/RECOMMENDATIONS scaffolding on every question.

**Two modes**
- **Strategic** (default for first question) — unchanged behavior. Full system
  prompt, full workspace dump, 4-section structured output.
- **Refine** (auto-selected for follow-ups) — slim conversational prompt,
  prior turns included as `[You] / [Overseer]` transcript, reduced context
  dump (just active-task-by-project + current fuel). No forced section
  headers. Target response length ~150 words.

**Auto-switching**
- First question in an empty thread: Strategic.
- Every question after: Refine (unless the user manually picks Strategic).
- Manual override shows an `auto` pill that returns to automatic selection.

**Server (`server/routes/overseer.ts`)**
- `POST /overseer/ask` and `POST /overseer/ask/start` now accept
  `mode: 'analysis' | 'refine'` and `history: Array<{role, text}>`.
- New `OVERSEER_REFINE_SYSTEM` prompt and `formatHistory()` helper (caps at
  last 8 turns, truncates each turn at 2000 chars to keep prompts lean).
- New `buildSlimContext()` function — drops per-project task dump, session
  history, and decisions list. Projects bucketed by open-task count, sorted
  desc. Falls back to `(no state)` when empty.

**Client (`client/src/modules/Overseer.jsx`)**
- Mode toggle Chip pair above the ask input, with placeholder text adapting
  to the active mode.
- Chat history entries now carry a `mode` field; a small `strategic` /
  `refine` badge renders beside each turn's role label. Absent on historic
  entries loaded from the advice journal (pre-v4.4.7 data).
- `askOverseer()` forwards `mode` + last 8 turns as history when refining.

**Tests** (`tests/overseerRefine.test.ts`)
- 11 new unit tests covering `formatHistory` (empty/short/long history, role
  labels, turn-count cap at 8, per-turn text cap at 2000 chars, unknown-role
  passthrough) and `buildSlimContext` (empty state, done-task filtering,
  project bucketing + sort, default-to-Nexus fallback, fuel line, length
  sanity).

201 → **212 tests** (+11 refine specs). 26 MCP tools.

## v4.4.6 — Audit Response

Response to the Overseer dashboard audit (advice #26) run immediately after
v4.4.4. Six polish-pass findings shipped in one release. No breaking changes.
(Version bumped to v4.4.6 after rebase — v4.4.5 was claimed by the doc-drift
hardening patch below, which landed concurrently.)

**Regression fix**
- `#379` Fuel `TaskCostPanel` — memoize known-categories set and collapse
  expand-state if the selected key falls off the set (e.g. after categorizer
  output shifts mid-session). Prevents orphaned expand state.

**UX improvements**
- `#380` Fleet → Graph quick-jump — new Network icon on each project card
  navigates to Graph/Visual with hiddenProjects seeded to everything except
  the target project. Audit flagged multi-click drill-down as friction. Added
  `navOptions` plumbing through App → ActiveComponent → Graph → VisualView
  for cross-module hints.
- `#381` Overseer Copy-as-Markdown — clipboard button on Strategic Analysis
  block and every Overseer chat answer. Transient "Copied" confirmation.
  Falls back to `document.execCommand('copy')` when `navigator.clipboard`
  is blocked (insecure context).
- `#382` Log scroll-to-top anchor — IntersectionObserver on a header sentinel
  detects when user scrolls away from latest; badge shows only when NEW events
  have arrived since leaving the top. Fixed-position bottom-right button
  smooth-scrolls back.

**Coherence**
- `#383` Shared `<Chip>` primitive — `client/src/components/Chip.jsx`.
  Two sizes (sm default / md), states (active / muted / default), renders as
  `<button>` when interactive or `<span>` when display-only. Migrated: Log
  time-range pills, Log sessions project chips, Overseer Q&A date-range pills,
  Overseer Q&A project chips. Graph view tabs + Fuel PLAN_DETAILS left alone
  (different visual role — tabs and rows, not chips).
- `#384` Empty-state tone standardized on **Status + Action/Education**.
  Log activity / sessions / timeline all gained actionable next-steps: "Clear
  all filters" when filters are active, or an education line pointing at the
  right mechanism (e.g. `nexus_log_session`) when genuinely empty.

26 MCP tools. Tests 189/189.

## v4.4.4 — Tier 2 Finale

Eight more Tier 2 items closed — the small/medium remainder of the UI-audit
Tier 2 backlog. The two BIG items (#343 Overseer refine mode, #307 LLM
contradiction detection) are carried forward to their own focused releases.

**Fuel (2 tasks)**
- `#264` Session Patterns headline metrics (burn rate, duration, fuel/session)
  now show week-over-week delta badges with color-coded direction. Analyzed
  sub-line exposes this-week / prior-week session counts.
- `#265` Task Cost by Category is click-to-expand — each row opens a list of
  the actual tasks that produced the average, with cost + session date.
  Server response now carries per-category task list.

**Dashboard (1 task)**
- `#238` ClockWidget week-ahead strip gains a burn-rate projection overlay.
  Server computes projected end-of-day weekly% based on 72h burn rate; UI
  tints days ≤40% (amber) / ≤15% (red), highlights the first day the line
  crosses zero with a red ring + "0%" label.

**Overseer (1 task)**
- `#344` Past Q&A now searchable once history ≥3 pairs. Three filter axes:
  free-text (question + answer), date range preset (today / 7d / 30d),
  detected-project chip. Filters compose as AND with a Clear pill.

**Graph Conflicts (2 tasks)**
- `#308` Empty-state copy expanded into three Q/A blocks: what is a conflict,
  why care, how to use it. Keeps the "No conflicts flagged" lead and the
  `rel='contradicts'` code tag.
- `#309` Always-visible historical counter row: Active · Ever flagged ·
  Resolved. "Ever flagged" counts all contradicts edges plus auto-detected
  potentials; "Resolved" counts flags where at least one endpoint decision
  is deprecated. Gives the tab a live state readout even at zero active.

**Log (2 tasks)**
- `#357` Time-range preset pills (All / Last hour / Today / 7d) narrow both
  the activity stream and the timeline view. Pairs with the existing search
  for precision lookups during bursty sessions.
- `#358` Per-type mute toggle — each type chip gains a small eye icon that
  hides that type from the stream for this session. Muted chips display
  struck-through. "Unmute all (N)" pill appears when any mute is active.
  Does not affect single-type-filter mode (user already narrowed).

No breaking changes. 26 MCP tools. Tests 189/189.

## v4.4.3 — Tier 2 Sweep II

12 more Tier 2 items closed. Mixed-theme release; Graph sub-tabs gain
meaningful interactivity.

**Fleet (3 tasks)**
- `#249` Cross-Project Priority rows show numeric score alongside `!!` bangs
- `#250` Project card title click → Command view
- `#251` "events/week" relabeled "events last 7d" with rolling-window tooltip

**Graph (8 tasks)**
- `#287` Blast Radius depth slider (1–4 hops); server `/impact/blast/:id`
  accepts `?depth=N`
- `#298` Centrality pagination — show top 15 by default with Load more /
  Show all / Collapse controls
- `#317` Holes healthy-projects label "×N decisions" (plural-aware)
- `#319` Holes hygiene warning — DIREWOLF / Projects artifacts show amber
  badge + ⚠ glyph (regression signal)
- `#330` Visual search/focus-by-ID input — matching nodes pulse; non-matching
  fade
- `#331` Visual controls hint ("drag node to move · click for details")
- `#334` Visual "Hide auto-linked" toggle — reveals the typed backbone by
  hiding `related` edges marked `auto-linked` or `semantic-linked`
- `#335` Visual color mode toggle — by project (default) or by cluster
  (connected-component). Makes "N clusters" claim visually verifiable.

**Log (1 task)**
- `#359` Expand-on-click for truncated messages via native `title` tooltip

**Docs**
- This CHANGELOG extended through v4.4.3
- README refresh (version + feature summary)
- GitHub repo description + topics updated

No breaking changes. 26 MCP tools. Tests 189/189.

## v4.4.2 — Tier 2 Sweep

First Tier 2 batch — 12 mixed-theme items. Key win: Graph sub-tabs finally
compose via `jumpToBlast` / `jumpToVisual` root helpers.

**Labels + precision**
- `#236` Dashboard Most Active "events" unit label
- `#237` Dashboard Thursday reset marker tooltip spells out weekly-fuel reset
- `#261` Fuel Learned Costs rounded from 3-decimal to 2 decimals
  (`1.953%` → `1.95%`)
- `#262` Fuel Session History column header + `pts` → `Readings`

**Overseer UX**
- `#345` Smart timestamps — today / yesterday / Nd / full date; hover shows
  full locale datetime
- `#346` Analyze Fleet button discloses cost: "~20-40s · ~1 GB VRAM spike on
  local AI · no Anthropic fuel"

**Graph discoverability**
- `#277` Knowledge Graph refresh button + spinner state
- `#263` Fuel time-of-day recommendation with n<2 + spread<10% guards to
  avoid n=1 false confidence

**Graph crosslinks**
- `#286` Blast Radius "Latest" shortcut — one-click analyze most-recent
  decision
- `#296` Centrality rows click-through to Blast Radius
- `#316` Holes orphan cards get "Link →" shortcut to Blast Radius
- `#329` Centrality hover Network icon deep-links to Visual with node focused

## v4.4.1 — Tier 1 Cleanup

12 remaining Tier 1 items closed. One of the larger single-release hauls.

**Headers + semantics**
- `#221` Command active-project chip when filtered
- `#246` Fleet "open tasks" → "not-done" with explicit semantics. Also fixed
  a real bug in `pulse.ts`: per-project task filter was title-substring-only,
  missing every task with a `project` field but no project name in the title.
  Nexus card was showing "2 open" when actual backlog was 150+.

**Log view**
- `#354` Activity entries click-through to source module
- `#355` Distinct icons + colors per event type (expanded TYPE_CONFIG for
  `graph` / `git_commit` / `git_fetch` / `memory_import`; sharpened existing —
  MapPin for Plotted, Lightbulb for Decision, Brain for Thought)
- `#356` Pagination beyond 200-cap with Load More button

**Graph polish**
- `#285` Blast Radius decision-ID autocomplete — new `DecisionPicker`
  combobox for type-searching by ID / text / project / tags
- `#306` Conflicts tab manual "Flag contradiction" form — first write-path
  on that tab; uses DecisionPicker for both endpoints
- `#315` Holes "Fragmented decision graphs" cards rearchitected with pill
  size badge, descriptor row, bordered divider, indented sample titles

**Live-data WS refresh**
- `#235` DigestWidget subscribes to WS events + freshness indicator + manual
  refresh
- `#247` WS_MAP extended so task / session / activity events invalidate
  `fleet` + `pulse` slices

**Overseer + audit**
- `#342` Dedup identical recent Ask questions (30-min window, soft-block
  with "Send anyway" override)
- `#314` Audited 77 anomalous Nexus ↔ Firewall-Godot cross-project edges —
  68/77 were fakes from generic-tag auto-linking (milestone ×52, github ×16).
  Added `GENERIC_TAGS` blacklist to `/ledger/auto-link`. v4.4.1-H3 migration
  pruned the residue at rest.

**New reusable primitive**
- `DecisionPicker.jsx` — combobox autocomplete for any "pick a decision"
  flow. Ready for future orphan-linking and Overseer "convert to decision"
  flows.

## v4.4.0 — Ambient Telemetry (final)

Consolidates v4.4.0-alpha + v4.4.0-beta into the stable v4.4.0 release. Adds two
final polish items:

- **v4.4.0-H2 hygiene migration** — normalizes the lowercase `"nexus"` project
  name (leaking in via `package.json`'s `"name"` field) to the canonical
  capital-N `"Nexus"` across all stored sessions / tasks / decisions. Extends
  the v4.3.9-H1 migration pattern. Residue surfaced in the v4.4.0-beta hook
  output's `Fleet uncommitted: Nexus: 1 · nexus: 1` line.
- **#369 Smarter project detection** — `cli/hooks/session-start.js` now checks
  `CLAUDE.md` for an explicit `# ProjectName` heading first, then falls through
  to `package.json`, `git remote`, and CWD basename. Every output is routed
  through a canonical casing map to kill the `nexus` / `Nexus` drift at the
  source.

No breaking changes from beta. Tests 189/189. 26 MCP tools.

## v4.4.0-beta — Ambient Telemetry Complete

Ships the four deferred items from alpha, closing the original Tier A+B
ambient-telemetry spec. `SessionStart` hook becomes async to support parallel
I/O.

- **#371 Tests baseline** — greps the last 10 commit messages for a
  `tests N/N green` pattern (leveraging our existing commit convention).
- **#373 Fleet-wide uncommitted** — bounded scan of the top-5 most-active
  projects from the sessions log. `git status --porcelain` per repo with 500ms
  timeout. `NEXUS_PROJECTS_DIR` env var configures the scan root.
- **#374 Overseer snapshot** — reads `_scheduledScans` in `nexus.json` and
  surfaces the latest digest + risk scan if fresh (<24h). Zero external calls.
- **#375 Services heartbeat** — parallel `net.createConnection` probes for
  LM Studio (`:1234`), Ollama (`:11434`), Dashboard (`:3001`), Vite (`:5173`).
  `Promise.all` batched; total cost ~200ms.

## v4.4.0-alpha — Ambient Telemetry (SessionStart)

First release of the v4.4 ambient-telemetry line. Enriches Claude's startup
context with 5 cheap high-value injections answering "what can Claude not see
that Nexus could provide?"

- **#368 Fuel freshness stamp** — `(read Nm ago)` + `⚠ STALE` warning over 2h.
- **#372 Git commits since last session** — `git log --since=<timestamp>` with
  the most-recent Nexus session as the cutoff.
- **#376 Memory pressure warning** — `⚠ elevated` ≥85% / `⚠ CRITICAL` ≥95% via
  `node:os`.
- **#377 Store health** — `nexus.json` size + backup freshness line.
- **#378 Working-tree diff summary** — `git diff --shortstat` one-liner when
  dirty.

## v4.3.10 — Graph Readability

10 Tier 1 fixes to the Knowledge Graph view and its 6 sub-tabs, selected for
"make the Graph view legible" theme.

- Centrality gets a column-header row, uniform truncation with hover-expand,
  and a "what's this?" degree-centrality explainer (#293, #294, #295).
- Visual gets hover tooltips including project name, an explicit project-color
  legend caption, and a V/A/D/P/R lifecycle letter legend. Fixed a missing
  `'R'` case in `lcLetter` that had v4.3.8 reference decisions rendering as
  `'A'` since their introduction (#325, #326, #327).
- Conflicts empty-state rewritten to stop implying active detection (#305).
- Blast Radius gains an explainer card + "Try one" chips auto-populated from
  most-recent + top-3 highest-centrality decisions (#284).
- Overview surfaces a `related` edge origin breakdown (keyword-auto /
  semantic-auto / manual) so signal is separable from auto-link noise (#271).
- Auto-link button becomes two-phase preview/confirm. Server supports
  `?dry_run=true` returning counts + up to 10 sample edges without writes
  (#272).

## v4.3.9 — Honest Instruments

10-task shortlist from the UI audit, themed "stop lying in the dashboard
before adding new surfaces."

Bug fixes: `#340` Overseer `undefined events` digest template, `#313` Graph
Overview Holes chip (was reading fragmented-project count instead of orphan
count — 7× under-reporting).

Label rewrites: `#234` "waiting for reset" session labels, `#233` System Pulse
"All instruments nominal" was lying at 97% memory.

Hygiene migration **v4.3.9-H1** (combining three tasks): U+FFFD mojibake scrub
across task titles and decisions, blank-project normalization across sessions
+ decisions (fixed Fleet Staleness `": 10d"` ghost row), `DIREWOLF` + `Projects`
alias normalization.

Features: `#259` shared `FuelFreshnessStamp` component, **`#220` Command-view
fuel widget** (the biggest UX win — session% / weekly% / minutes-left inline
on the landing page), `#341` Risk Scanner expanded from 5 to 9 categories.

## v4.3.8 — Memory Bridge First-Run Import

Ships the 26th MCP tool `nexus_import_cc_memories`. Scans
`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/*.md` (CC's auto-memory files) and imports each
as a `lifecycle: 'reference'` decision in the Ledger, tagged `cc-memory`.
Idempotent by design — file-path dedup via a new `_memoryImports` map on the
store. Mtime drift triggers update-in-place. Supports `dry_run`, `force`,
`project` filter.

Pre-existing gap fixed: `/api/cc-memory` was only served in standalone mode;
now wired in `dashboard.ts` too.

Tests 176 → 184 (+7 hermetic fixtures in `tests/memoryBridgeImport.test.js`).

## v4.3.7 — Version Visibility + Drift Prevention

Adds `nexus_version` (25th MCP tool) so "which Nexus is serving this session?"
has a definitive answer. Reports version, mode, applied migrations, tool
count, uptime, and overseer availability.

Single source of truth: `server/lib/version.ts` reads from root
`package.json`. Added a CI drift test asserting `TOOL_COUNT_EXPECTED` matches
both the `TOOLS` array AND `mcpb/manifest.json`.

## v4.3.6 — Audit Shakedown Patch

External-audit-driven patch. Security: `github.ts` `/commit` switched from
`execSync` with quote-escaping to `execFileSync` with argv, closing a command-
injection vector via the message body. Added `safeProject()` path-traversal
guard.

Idempotent migrations: new `_appliedMigrations` ledger records migration IDs
+ ISO timestamps so cold-start skips scans instead of re-walking tasks.
Bundle artifacts moved to `.gitignore` (rebuild locally).

## Before that

v4.3.5 and earlier: see git history and the tagged releases on GitHub.
